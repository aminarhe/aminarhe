## Heyooooo, I'm Amina üßâ

I love automating complex systems. My background spans competitive math, software, robotics engineering.


I believe technology should be accessible, inclusive, and serve the goal of making the world a better place.

**üåê [View my full portfolio website](https://aminarhe.mmm.page/) for detailed project showcases - much of my work is in private repos or not on github.**

Some topics that fascinate me: swarm intelligence, bio-inspired robotic designs, optimization problems, decision-making systems, computer vision. My go-to languages are Python and TypeScript (and I have a weird appreciation for RegEx).
Currently engaged in brain-computer interfaces and assistive robotics research in Buenos Aires.
